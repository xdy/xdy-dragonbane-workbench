Various qol features for the Foundry VTT Drakar & Demoner / Dragonbane system.

## Features

* General
  * Option to remind when attack is made by a token that probably can't attack (due to being dead or grappled), or just cancel impossible attacks.
  * Option to remind when an attack is made without targeting, or just cancel untargeted attacks.

* Experimental features:
  * If a feature name starts with mentioning that it's experimental, use with caution. It's probably barely tested and
    may wreck your chat or brick your world. (No warranty expressed or implied. No user serviceable parts inside. Void
    where prohibited. Ei saa peittää. Do not taunt happy fun ball: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqeZl8OI2M)

* Deprecated features (will be removed eventually):
  * None currently.

* Recently removed features:
  * None currently

## The Programmer's Mantra

```

It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion
It is by the beans of Java that thoughts acquire speed
The hands acquire shakes
The shakes become a warning
It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion
